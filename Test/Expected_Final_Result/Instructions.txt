Thank you for using Fast Analyzr BE!

All results are stored in the Final_result folder, including this file with post-analysis instructions. For each Batch file, a separate folder will be created. Inside these folders, you will find the compiled_reads and compiled_heatmaps directories, as well as the final_result.xlsx and final_result.tiff files. Additionally, the indels.xlsx file may be generated in certain cases, as described at the end of this document.

In the compiled_reads folder, you will find a file for each sample displaying the Allele plot obtained using Crispresso2. The compiled_heatmaps folder contains a heatmap representing gene editing, along with the indel values for each sample individually.

The final_result.xlsx file consists of three sheets:
1. Reads: Contains data for each sample. A legend is provided, and columns are color-coded based on the legend's criteria. The following three columns are included:
   - Total_reads
   - Aligned_reads
   - Aligned_percentage

2. Editing: Displays editing data in percentage (A-to-G for ABE and C-to-T for CBE). Only A or C nucleotides and their positions within the gRNA are represented.

3. Indel: Contains indel values, represented by the following columns:
   - Insertion_Reads
   - Insertion_Percentage
   - Deletion_Reads
   - Deletion_Percentage
   - Indel_Percentage

The final_result.tiff file is a heatmap plot displaying editing rates and indel values for each sample. If the number of samples exceed 12, multiple heatmaps will be generated.

Finally, the indels.xlsx file will be generated if any sample exhibits an indel frequency higher than 0.2%. Samples meeting this criterion will be placed in separate sheets within the file.

Any deviation from the expected outputs described above may indicate an error in script execution. Please carefully review these instructions.

If the haplotypes function is activated, after the completion of the editing analyses all detected gRNA sequences will be listed, and you will be asked to provide the desired positions to analyze. After that, for each Batch file a haplotypes.xlsx file will be generated containing the different possible haplotypes for the specified positions, and a haplotypes_stacked_bar.png file will be created to visualize these results. Haplotypes with a frequency lower than 1% will not be reported in the chart legend and will be grouped as Other Haplotypes to facilitate visualization.

Enjoy analyzing your results!
